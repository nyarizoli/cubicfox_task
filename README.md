# Steps of starting the application

First step to clone the repository

After the repository cloned, navigate to the angular application's source folder (test-task) and run "npm install" to install node dependencies

When the dependencies installed successfully a folder called "node_modules" should appear, and after that run "npm run start" command on the application's source folder (test-task), that will compile and serve the application, what can be found in the browser on the "localhost:4200" address
